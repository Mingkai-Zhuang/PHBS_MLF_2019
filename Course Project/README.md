## Project Introduction
* Goal: Predict the return of a stock, given the history of the past few days.
* The datasets provide 5-day windows of time, days D-2, D-1, D, D+1, and D+2. We are given returns in days D-2, D-1, and part of day D, and we will predict the returns in the rest of day D, and in days D+1 and D+2.
During day D, there is intraday return data, which are the returns at different points in the day. The datasets provide 180 minutes of data, from t=1 to t=180. In the training set we are given the full 180 minutes, in the test set just the first 120 minutes are provided.
For each 5-day window, datasets also provide 25 features, Feature_1 to Feature_25. Each row in the dataset is an arbitrary stock at an arbitrary 5 day time window.

## Data
### Data Download
The datasets downloaded from [Kaggle-The Winton Stock Market Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-winton-stock-market-challenge/data).

### Data Files Descrition
**Noteï¼š** Because of the limited size of files uploaded to GitHub, we only upload a part of our datasets but include all specific labels.
* train.xlsx - the training set, including the columns of:
  * Feature_1 - Feature_25
  * Ret_MinusTwo, Ret_MinusOne
  * Ret_2 - Ret_120
  * Ret_121 - Ret_180: target variables
  * Ret_PlusOne, Ret_PlusTwo: target variables
  * Weight_Intraday, Weight_Daily
* test.xlsx - the test set, including the columns of:
  * Feature_1 - Feature_25
  * Ret_MinusTwo, Ret_MinusOne
  * Ret_2 - Ret_120

### Specific Label
* Feature_1 to Feature_25: different features relevant to prediction.
* Ret_MinusTwo: this is the return from the close of trading on day D-2 to the close of trading on day D-1 (i.e. 1 day).
* Ret_MinusOne: this is the return from the close of trading on day D-1 to the point at which the intraday returns start on day D (approximately 1/2 day).
* Ret_2 to Ret_120: these are returns over approximately one minute on day D. Ret_2 is the return between t=1 and t=2.
* Ret_121 to Ret180: intraday returns over approximately one minute on day D. These are the target variables you need to predict as {id}{1-60}.
* Ret_PlusOne: this is the return from the time Ret_180 is measured on day D to the close of trading on day D+1. (approximately 1 day). * This is a target variable we need to predict as {id}_61.
* Ret_PlusTwo: this is the return from the close of trading on day D+1 to the close of trading on day D+2 (i.e. 1 day) This is a target variable you need to predict as {id}_62.
* Weight_Intraday: weight used to evaluate intraday return predictions Ret 121 to 180.
* Weight_Daily: weight used to evaluate daily return predictions (Ret_PlusOne and Ret_PlusTwo).

## [Data Analysis](https://github.com/Mingkai-Zhuang/PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Course%20Project/Code/Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
Because the datasets are complicated, we make some basic analysis for it, which can help us better understand data itself. 

Firstly, Ret_2 - Ret_120 are return per minute at Day D(intraday). However, the aggregative return at 120 minute is more useful. Hence, we sum these data and calculate standard deviation. We name them by R_Agg,	R_Agg_Std	and R_Std respectively.

Secondly, we can find that some data are integer and some others are decimal from the ```.csv``` files. Apart from these, some data are missing. In order to better use these data, we will try to understand natures of these features. The part of the tabel is the analysis results.(You can see the original tabel in [```Data Analysis.ipynb``` ](https://github.com/Mingkai-Zhuang/PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Course%20Project/Code/Data%20Analysis.ipynb) )

**Analysis Label Description:** 
* Missing and Missing % represent the number and percentage of missing data.
* Unique and Unique % represent the number and percentage of unique numbers, which can help determine the category features.
* Special and Special % represent the number and percentage of the most unique numbers, which can help determine the category features.
* Singular and Singular % represent the number and percentage of singular values.

**Summary of data:**
After some simple analysis, we can divide the features to two labels -- numerical features and category features.
Classification | Specific Features or Index
:------:  |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:
Numerical Features | 'Feature_2', 'Feature_3', 'Feature_4', 'Feature_6','Feature_11', 'Feature_14', 'Feature_17', 'Feature_18', 'Feature_19','Feature_21', 'Feature_22', 'Feature_23', 'Feature_24','Feature_25','Ret_MinusTwo', 'Ret_MinusOne', 'R_Agg', 'R_Agg_Std','R_Std' 
Category Features |  'Feature_1', 'Feature_5', 'Feature_7', 'Feature_8', 'Feature_9', 'Feature_10','Feature_12', 'Feature_13','Feature_15', 'Feature_16', 'Feature_20' 

## [Visual Data Analysis](https://github.com/Mingkai-Zhuang/PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Course%20Project/Code/Visual%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
In this part, we will try to get a better understanding of the properties of different features and their relation to the targets by plotting:
* the features' correlations
* the distributions of the features
* regression plots for the features.

Through the distributions graph, most of the features don't have a normal distribution. 

By the correlation heatmap and the regression plots, we could see the evidence of correlations both within features and between features and targets. 

![heatmap](https://github.com/Mingkai-Zhuang/PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Course%20Project/Images/heatmap.png)

Moreover, some features have higher correlations which present a pattern of clusters, which are:
* [Feature_3 - Feature_11] & [Feature_3 - Feature_11]
* [Feature_3 - Feature_11] & [Feature_17 - Feature_25]
* [Feature_17 - Feature_25] & [Feature_17 - Feature_25]

**Visual Data Analysis After Processing:**

In the part of data Processing, we deal with the issues above, normalizing the features and eliminating the correlation between features and targets.
